Problem 1 (compareUpdateArrays.php): 
you will find two sets of data from different sources which need to be synced. The two sets share a common key field; ‘customerID’ in set A and ‘CustomerNumber’ in set B. Each set has a ‘dateUpdated’ which represents the last change time for the entity. Analyze both sets and prepare updates for each set from the rows in the
other set that are missing or outdated.

Problem 2(upcomingServiceDate.php):
Logic: A customer signs up for a recurring seasonal service. Write a function that determines if an upcoming service date falls inside of a season defined by a given season start and season end. 

Input Parameters
  Season start: month and day season begins in any year
  Season end: month and day season ends in any year
  Service date: formatted as yyyy-mm-dd

Output: boolean : true or false if the service date falls within the season start and season end.
