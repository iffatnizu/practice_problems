# Problem 1: 
you will find two sets of data from different sources which need to be synced. The two sets share a common key field; ‘customerID’ in set A and ‘CustomerNumber’ in set B. Each set has a ‘dateUpdated’ which represents the last change time for the entity. Analyze both sets and prepare updates for each set from the rows in the
other set that are missing or outdated.
